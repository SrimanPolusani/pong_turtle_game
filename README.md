<h1>pong_turtle_game</h1>
<p>It is a ping-pong game built with Turtle module. It had three objects which inherited Turtle object, namely Ball, Paddle and ScoreBoard. The code for keyboard commands is in main.py. When ball hits the paddle, it changes the sign of ball's y coordinate to create the bounce. Relocation of the paddle and ball happens after every match. Every bounce on the paddle changes the colour of ball and paddle randomly from a selected set of colours. The velocity of the ball and the movement of the paddle increases gradually.</p>
<h3>This project is built using the following tools:</h3>
